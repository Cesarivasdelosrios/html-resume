<p>I'm a Internationalist graduated from the Universidad Central de Venezuela. 30 years old, I have been translating live and in video conferences for 5 years. I speak Spanish, Portuguese and English. I am currently working in the world of programming. I became interested in the area once I had the opportunity to work in companies dedicated to Artificial Intelligence and enterprise software solutions.</p>

<p>I am currently studying online programming with Dr. Angela Yu in order to specialize in the area and work as a full stack developer in large companies.</p>
    
<p>Once I have the necessary experience, I would like to concentrate my efforts in the field of video game development, as it is one of the things I have been passionate about since my childhood.</p>    
<p>If you wish, we could have a brief chat about your project.</p>
